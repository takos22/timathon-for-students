My submission for the 2nd Timathon. I made 3 projects around the "For Students" theme:

- an API
- a wrapper for that API
- a website around the API

## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

The timathon theme is "For students". So I had to make something that could be useful for students and that could help them in their everyday life.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

I thought about making an API for homeworks, timetables and other things useful to students. However an API wouldn't be that easy to use, so I made a wrapper for it. But again, you would have to write code and not every student can do that, that's why I decided to make a website for it.

Students are able to add homeworks, timetables and more things that could help them at school.

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

I'm going to add more endpoints to the API so more functions in the wrapper and more things on the website. If you have any ideas/suggestions, you can leave an issue with a [feature request tag](https://github.com/takos22/timathon2-for-students/labels/feature%20request).

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the project <a name = "running"></a>

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.
